**Note:** This library is licensed under both GPLv2 and commercial license
terms.

The inemat header only library defines the interface inem uses to access its
underlying matrix library.  You can use this API to define your own low level
implementation of common matrix functions if porting *Aion* to new processor
architectures or if you intend to use the *Aion* built output on custom
hardware with matrix acceleration functions.

The library is used as part of the *Aion* application, for details, see our
website at https://inesonic.com .
